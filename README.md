# DiaDraw Task

DiaDraw - Task â„–1

Instructions:

1. Open the client folder inside the terminal
2. Type "npm i"
3. Type "npm start", the react client should begin compiling
4. Open the server folder inside another terminal window
5. Type "npm i"
6. Type "npm start", nodemon should start the express.js server
7. Take a look inside the "app.js" file inside the "server" folder. Notice the "registeredUsers" object. It is meant to emulate already registered users, since the gist of the task requires emulating a login process to an already registered profile. Feel free to modify the contents of the object. The "loginHistory" array includes all login attempts during the lifecycle of the server. All items inside this array are visible AND editable from the login entries table, which is accessible upon successful login.
